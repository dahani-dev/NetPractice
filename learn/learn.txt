======================== IP Address ========================

An IP address consists of 4 octets, and each octet contains 8 bits.
This gives a total of 32 bits.

Example of an IP address: 192.168.1.1
=> First octet  : 192
=> Second octet : 168
=> Third octet  : 1
=> Fourth octet : 1

============================================================


======================== IP Classes ========================

=> Class A
   - First octet range : 1 to 126
   - Subnet mask       : 255.0.0.0
   - Network part      : 1st octet
   - Host part         : last 3 octets

=> Class B
   - First octet range : 128 to 191
   - Subnet mask       : 255.255.0.0
   - Network part      : 1st and 2nd octets
   - Host part         : last 2 octets

=> Class C
   - First octet range : 192 to 223
   - Subnet mask       : 255.255.255.0
   - Network part      : 1st, 2nd, and 3rd octets
   - Host part         : 4th octet

=> Class D (Multicast)
   - First octet range : 224 to 239
   - Not used for host addressing
   - Used for multicast traffic

=> Class E (Experimental)
   - First octet range : 240 to 255
   - Reserved for research and experimental use
   - Not assigned to hosts

============================================================


=================== Extra Information ======================

If you pay attention, Class A starts from 1 to 126, and Class B starts from 128 to 191.
Why is 127 skipped?

Because the IP range 127.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255 is reserved for **loopback** addresses.
The most common is **127.0.0.1**, which refers to **localhost** — the machine refers to itself.

============================================================


=============== Example: Network with 4 Machines ============

Let’s take an example where we have a network with 4 machines.
The network IP is: 192.168.1.0

=> Machine 1 : IP 192.168.1.1  
=> Machine 2 : IP 192.168.1.2  
=> Machine 3 : IP 192.168.1.3  
=> Machine 4 : IP 192.168.1.4  

Note:
- The address ending with `.0` is the **network address** and cannot be assigned to a host.
- The address ending with `.255` is the **broadcast address**, used to send messages to all hosts in the network.

============================================================


====================== Types of IP =========================

=> **Public IP**
   - Used to identify devices on the internet.
   - Must be unique and globally routable.
   - Assigned by ISPs or registries.

=> **Private IP**
   - Used within local/private networks.
   - Not routable on the internet.
   - Can be reused across different networks.

============================================================


====================== What is IPv4? ========================

IPv4 stands for **Internet Protocol version 4**.
- It uses 32-bit addresses (4 octets).
- Can support around **4.3 billion** unique IP addresses.

============================================================


=============== Private IP Address Ranges ==================

=> Class A : 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255  
=> Class B : 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255  
=> Class C : 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255  

These ranges are reserved for **private networks**.

============================================================


========================= IPv6 =============================

IPv6 is the successor to IPv4 and uses **128-bit** addresses.

- Represented as 8 groups of 4 hexadecimal digits.
- Example: `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`
- IPv6 provides a huge address space:  
  **≈ 3.4 × 10³⁸ addresses**, enough for every device on Earth.
